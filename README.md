# BinLing

BinLing is an execution language used within the VM4AI framework to bind intent,
constraints, and behavior into verifiable machine-readable blocks.

It exists to make AI execution deterministic, inspectable, and fail-safe in
systems where “best effort” behavior is not sufficient.

## What BinLing Is
- An execution and encoding protocol
- A foundation for intent-bound AI workflows
- A machine-readable layer beneath higher-level tools

## What BinLing Is Not
- A general-purpose programming language
- A human-facing syntax
- A model replacement or inference engine

## Status
BinLing is under active development.
Current work targets **v0.1**, focusing on:
- the Levin execution method
- lattice-based activation semantics
- strict encoding and verification rules
